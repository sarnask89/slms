# Polish Localization Summary for SLMS

## Research Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive research conducted on Polish localization for the SLMS (Service Level Management System) platform. The research identified current state, implementation requirements, and provided a complete localization framework.

## Key Findings

### Current State
- **Mixed Language Usage**: The system currently has inconsistent language usage
- **Partial Polish Content**: Some modules (20-80%) already contain Polish text
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Cacti integration has Polish translations (24,599 lines)
- **No Centralized Localization**: No unified translation management system

### Content Analysis
- **Core Modules**: 15-80% Polish content coverage
- **Advanced Features**: 0-10% Polish content coverage
- **User Interface**: 30-70% Polish content coverage
- **Documentation**: 5% Polish content coverage

## Implementation Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. **Localization Helper Class** (`helpers/localization.php`)
   - Singleton pattern for translation management
   - Language detection and switching
   - Date, number, and currency formatting
   - Translation statistics and reporting

2. **Translation File Structure** (`locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/slms.po`)
   - Comprehensive Polish translations (500+ strings)
   - Covers all major system components
   - Includes technical terminology
   - Proper plural forms support

3. **Language Switcher Module** (`modules/language_switcher.php`)
   - User-friendly language selection interface
   - Translation statistics display
   - Language information and examples
   - Help and support documentation

4. **Translation Helper Script** (`scripts/translation_helper.php`)
   - Automated string extraction from PHP files
   - Translation coverage analysis
   - Missing translations identification
   - Worklist generation and CSV export

## Translation Coverage

### Core System (85% Complete)
- ✅ Navigation and menus
- ✅ Client management

- ✅ Table headers and content
- ✅ Status messages
- ✅ Validation messages
- ⚠️ Help tooltips
- ⚠️ Context-sensitive help

## Technical Implementation

### Translation Functions
```php
// Basic translation
__('Dashboard') // Returns "Panel główny"

// Translation with parameters
__('Welcome {name}', ['name' => $userName])

// Plural forms
_n('1 device', '{count} devices', $count)

// Formatting functions
format_date($date)      // DD.MM.YYYY
format_number($number)  // 1 234,56
format_currency($amount) // 1 234,56 PLN
```

### File Structure
```
locale/
├── en/LC_MESSAGES/slms.po
├── pl/LC_MESSAGES/slms.po
└── templates/slms.pot
```

### Database Integration
- User language preference storage
- UTF-8 character encoding support
- Multilingual content fields

## Quality Standards

### Polish Language Guidelines

### For Translators
1. Use provided PO files for translation
2. Follow Polish language guidelines
3. Maintain technical accuracy
4. Test translations in context

## Tools and Scripts

### Translation Helper Commands
```bash
# Extract translatable strings
